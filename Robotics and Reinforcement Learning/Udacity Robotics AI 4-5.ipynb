    "\n",
    "The uncertainty in velocity can decrease with measurement of position only due to the dependence of position on velocity (not at all statistically independent as $x^{'}=x+\\dot{x}\\delta t$). The velocity is a $\\textbf{hidden variable}$, and the position an $\\textbf{observed variable}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The likelihood (measurement pdf) is a Gaussian with high variance in the velocity axis and small in the position axis (as it is position that is measured in the sensing step), and the prior function is a Gaussian with greates covariance in the joint velocity, space line (uncertainty both in velocity and space). The product posterior distribution is more centralised in both the velocity and space axes."
